# In this compose file we define a dockergen container which is running the docker-gen process with the
# `-only-exposed` option. This should not be an issue since the template for the nginx config file should only
# have to deal with upstream containers which are required to have at least one port exposed, and since the nginx
# container with no exposed port makes no sense.
