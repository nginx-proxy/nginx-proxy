nginx-proxy sets up a container running nginx and [docker-gen][1].  docker-gen generate reverse proxy configs for nginx and reloads nginx when containers they are started and stopped.

See [Automated Nginx Reverse Proxy for Docker][2] for why you might want to use this.

### Usage

To run it:

    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock -v /path/to/nginx/certificates:/etc/nginx/certificates -t jwilder/nginx-proxy

Then start any containers you want proxied with an env var VIRTUAL_HOST=subdomain.youdomain.com

    $ docker run -e VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com -t ...

Provided your DNS is setup to forward foo.bar.com to the a host running nginx-proxy, the request will be routed to a container with the VIRTUAL_HOST env var set.

### Multiple Ports

If your container exposes multiple ports, nginx-proxy will default to the service running on port 80.  If you need to specify a different port, you can set a VIRTUAL_PORT env var to select a different one.  If your container only exposes one port and it has a VIRTUAL_HOST env var set, that port will be selected.
