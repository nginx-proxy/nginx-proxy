nginx-proxy sets up a container running nginx and [docker-gen][1].  docker-gen generates reverse proxy configs for nginx and reloads nginx when containers are started and stopped.

See [Automated Nginx Reverse Proxy for Docker][2] for why you might want to use this.

### Usage

To run it:

    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy

Then start any containers you want proxied with an env var `VIRTUAL_HOST=subdomain.youdomain.com`

    $ docker run -e VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com  ...

The containers being proxied must [expose](https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#expose-incoming-ports) the port to be proxied, either by using the `EXPOSE` directive in their `Dockerfile` or by using the `--expose` flag to `docker run` or `docker create`.

Provided your DNS is setup to forward foo.bar.com to the a host running nginx-proxy, the request will be routed to a container with the VIRTUAL_HOST env var set.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  nginx-proxy:
    image: jwilder/nginx-proxy
    container_name: nginx-proxy
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro

  whoami:
    image: jwilder/whoami
    container_name: whoami
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=whoami.local
```

```shell
$ docker-compose up
$ curl -H "Host: whoami.local" localhost
I'm 5b129ab83266
```

### Multiple Ports

If your container exposes multiple ports, nginx-proxy will default to the service running on port 80.  If you need to specify a different port, you can set a VIRTUAL_PORT env var to select a different one.  If your container only exposes one port and it has a VIRTUAL_HOST env var set, that port will be selected.

### Multiple Hosts

If you need to support multiple virtual hosts for a container, you can separate each entry with commas.  For example, `foo.bar.com,baz.bar.com,bar.com` and each host will be setup the same.

### Wildcard Hosts

You can also use wildcards at the beginning and the end of host name, like `*.bar.com` or `foo.bar.*`. Or even a regular expression, which can be very useful in conjunction with a wildcard DNS service like [xip.io](http://xip.io), using `~^foo\.bar\..*\.xip\.io` will match `foo.bar.127.0.0.1.xip.io`, `foo.bar.10.0.2.2.xip.io` and all other given IPs. More information about this topic can be found in the nginx documentation about [`server_names`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html).

### Multiple Networks

With the addition of [overlay networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-overlay/) in Docker 1.9, your `nginx-proxy` container may need to connect to backend containers on multiple networks. By default, if you don't pass the `--net` flag when your `nginx-proxy` container is created, it will only be attached to the default `bridge` network. This means that it will not be able to connect to containers on networks other than `bridge`.

If you want your `nginx-proxy` container to be attached to a different network, you must pass the `--net=my-network` option in your `docker create` or `docker run` command. At the time of this writing, only a single network can be specified at container creation time. To attach to other networks, you can use the `docker network connect` command after your container is created:

```console
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
    --name my-nginx-proxy --net my-network jwilder/nginx-proxy
$ docker network connect my-other-network my-nginx-proxy
```

In this example, the `my-nginx-proxy` container will be connected to `my-network` and `my-other-network` and will be able to proxy to other containers attached to those networks.

### SSL Backends

If you would like to connect to your backend using HTTPS instead of HTTP, set `VIRTUAL_PROTO=https` on the backend container.

### uWSGI Backends

If you would like to connect to uWSGI backend, set `VIRTUAL_PROTO=uwsgi` on the
backend container. Your backend container should than listen on a port rather
than a socket and expose that port.

### Default Host

To set the default host for nginx use the env var `DEFAULT_HOST=foo.bar.com` for example

    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 -e DEFAULT_HOST=foo.bar.com -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy


### Separate Containers

nginx-proxy can also be run as two separate containers using the [jwilder/docker-gen](https://index.docker.io/u/jwilder/docker-gen/)
image and the official [nginx](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) image.

You may want to do this to prevent having the docker socket bound to a publicly exposed container service.

You can demo this pattern with docker-compose:

```console
$ docker-compose --file docker-compose-separate-containers.yml up
$ curl -H "Host: whoami.local" localhost
I'm 5b129ab83266
```

To run nginx proxy as a separate container you'll need to have [nginx.tmpl](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy/blob/master/nginx.tmpl) on your host system.

First start nginx with a volume:


    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx -v /tmp/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d -t nginx

Then start the docker-gen container with the shared volume and template:

```
$ docker run --volumes-from nginx \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
    -v $(pwd):/etc/docker-gen/templates \
    -t jwilder/docker-gen -notify-sighup nginx -watch /etc/docker-gen/templates/nginx.tmpl /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

Finally, start your containers with `VIRTUAL_HOST` environment variables.

    $ docker run -e VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com  ...

### SSL Support

SSL is supported using single host, wildcard and SNI certificates using naming conventions for
certificates or optionally specifying a cert name (for SNI) as an environment variable.

To enable SSL:

    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /path/to/certs:/etc/nginx/certs -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy

The contents of `/path/to/certs` should contain the certificates and private keys for any virtual
hosts in use.  The certificate and keys should be named after the virtual host with a `.crt` and
`.key` extension.  For example, a container with `VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com` should have a
`foo.bar.com.crt` and `foo.bar.com.key` file in the certs directory.

#### Diffie-Hellman Groups

If you have Diffie-Hellman groups enabled, the files should be named after the virtual host with a
`dhparam` suffix and `.pem` extension. For example, a container with `VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com`
should have a `foo.bar.com.dhparam.pem` file in the certs directory.

#### Wildcard Certificates

Wildcard certificates and keys should be named after the domain name with a `.crt` and `.key` extension.
For example `VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com` would use cert name `bar.com.crt` and `bar.com.key`.

#### SNI

If your certificate(s) supports multiple domain names, you can start a container with `CERT_NAME=<name>`
to identify the certificate to be used.  For example, a certificate for `*.foo.com` and `*.bar.com`
could be named `shared.crt` and `shared.key`.  A container running with `VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com`
and `CERT_NAME=shared` will then use this shared cert.

#### How SSL Support Works

The SSL cipher configuration is based on [mozilla nginx intermediate profile](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Nginx) which
should provide compatibility with clients back to Firefox 1, Chrome 1, IE 7, Opera 5, Safari 1,
Windows XP IE8, Android 2.3, Java 7.  The configuration also enables HSTS, and SSL
session caches.

The default behavior for the proxy when port 80 and 443 are exposed is as follows:

* If a container has a usable cert, port 80 will redirect to 443 for that container so that HTTPS
is always preferred when available.
* If the container does not have a usable cert, a 503 will be returned.

Note that in the latter case, a browser may get an connection error as no certificate is available
to establish a connection.  A self-signed or generic cert named `default.crt` and `default.key`
will allow a client browser to make a SSL connection (likely w/ a warning) and subsequently receive
a 503.

To serve traffic in both SSL and non-SSL modes without redirecting to SSL, you can include the
environment variable `HTTPS_METHOD=noredirect` (the default is `HTTPS_METHOD=redirect`).  You can also
disable the non-SSL site entirely with `HTTPS_METHOD=nohttp`. `HTTPS_METHOD` must be specified
on each container for which you want to override the default behavior.  If `HTTPS_METHOD=noredirect` is
used, Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is disabled to prevent HTTPS users from being redirected by the
client.  If you cannot get to the HTTP site after changing this setting, your browser has probably cached
the HSTS policy and is automatically redirecting you back to HTTPS.  You will need to clear your browser's
HSTS cache or use an incognito window / different browser.

### Basic Authentication Support

In order to be able to secure your virtual host, you have to create a file named as its equivalent VIRTUAL_HOST variable on directory
/etc/nginx/htpasswd/$VIRTUAL_HOST

```
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    -v /path/to/htpasswd:/etc/nginx/htpasswd \
    -v /path/to/certs:/etc/nginx/certs \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
    jwilder/nginx-proxy
```

You'll need apache2-utils on the machine where you plan to create the htpasswd file. Follow these [instructions](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/htpasswd.html)

### Custom Nginx Configuration

If you need to configure Nginx beyond what is possible using environment variables, you can provide custom configuration files on either a proxy-wide or per-`VIRTUAL_HOST` basis.

#### Replacing default proxy settings

If you want to replace the default proxy settings for the nginx container, add a configuration file at `/etc/nginx/proxy.conf`. A file with the default settings would
look like this:

```Nginx
# HTTP 1.1 support
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_buffering off;
proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection $proxy_connection;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $proxy_x_forwarded_proto;

# Mitigate httpoxy attack (see README for details)
proxy_set_header Proxy "";
```

***NOTE***: If you provide this file it will replace the defaults; you may want to check the .tmpl file to make sure you have all of the needed options.

***NOTE***: The default configuration blocks the `Proxy` HTTP request header from being sent to downstream servers.  This prevents attackers from using the so-called [httpoxy attack](http://httpoxy.org).  There is no legitimate reason for a client to send this header, and there are many vulnerable languages / platforms (`CVE-2016-5385`, `CVE-2016-5386`, `CVE-2016-5387`, `CVE-2016-5388`, `CVE-2016-1000109`, `CVE-2016-1000110`, `CERT-VU#797896`).

#### Proxy-wide

To add settings on a proxy-wide basis, add your configuration file under `/etc/nginx/conf.d` using a name ending in `.conf`.

This can be done in a derived image by creating the file in a `RUN` command or by `COPY`ing the file into `conf.d`:

```Dockerfile
FROM jwilder/nginx-proxy
RUN { \
      echo 'server_tokens off;'; \
      echo 'client_max_body_size 100m;'; \
    } > /etc/nginx/conf.d/my_proxy.conf
```

Or it can be done by mounting in your custom configuration in your `docker run` command:

    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /path/to/my_proxy.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/my_proxy.conf:ro -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy

#### Per-VIRTUAL_HOST

To add settings on a per-`VIRTUAL_HOST` basis, add your configuration file under `/etc/nginx/vhost.d`. Unlike in the proxy-wide case, which allows multiple config files with any name ending in `.conf`, the per-`VIRTUAL_HOST` file must be named exactly after the `VIRTUAL_HOST`.

In order to allow virtual hosts to be dynamically configured as backends are added and removed, it makes the most sense to mount an external directory as `/etc/nginx/vhost.d` as opposed to using derived images or mounting individual configuration files.

For example, if you have a virtual host named `app.example.com`, you could provide a custom configuration for that host as follows:

    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /path/to/vhost.d:/etc/nginx/vhost.d:ro -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy
    $ { echo 'server_tokens off;'; echo 'client_max_body_size 100m;'; } > /path/to/vhost.d/app.example.com

If you are using multiple hostnames for a single container (e.g. `VIRTUAL_HOST=example.com,www.example.com`), the virtual host configuration file must exist for each hostname. If you would like to use the same configuration for multiple virtual host names, you can use a symlink:

    $ { echo 'server_tokens off;'; echo 'client_max_body_size 100m;'; } > /path/to/vhost.d/www.example.com
    $ ln -s /path/to/vhost.d/www.example.com /path/to/vhost.d/example.com

#### Per-VIRTUAL_HOST default configuration

If you want most of your virtual hosts to use a default single configuration and then override on a few specific ones, add those settings to the `/etc/nginx/vhost.d/default` file. This file
will be used on any virtual host which does not have a `/etc/nginx/vhost.d/{VIRTUAL_HOST}` file associated with it.

#### Per-VIRTUAL_HOST location configuration

To add settings to the "location" block on a per-`VIRTUAL_HOST` basis, add your configuration file under `/etc/nginx/vhost.d`
just like the previous section except with the suffix `_location`.

For example, if you have a virtual host named `app.example.com` and you have configured a proxy_cache `my-cache` in another custom file, you could tell it to use a proxy cache as follows:

    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /path/to/vhost.d:/etc/nginx/vhost.d:ro -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy
    $ { echo 'proxy_cache my-cache;'; echo 'proxy_cache_valid  200 302  60m;'; echo 'proxy_cache_valid  404 1m;' } > /path/to/vhost.d/app.example.com_location

If you are using multiple hostnames for a single container (e.g. `VIRTUAL_HOST=example.com,www.example.com`), the virtual host configuration file must exist for each hostname. If you would like to use the same configuration for multiple virtual host names, you can use a symlink:

    $ { echo 'proxy_cache my-cache;'; echo 'proxy_cache_valid  200 302  60m;'; echo 'proxy_cache_valid  404 1m;' } > /path/to/vhost.d/app.example.com_location
    $ ln -s /path/to/vhost.d/www.example.com /path/to/vhost.d/example.com

#### Per-VIRTUAL_HOST location default configuration

If you want most of your virtual hosts to use a default single `location` block configuration and then override on a few specific ones, add those settings to the `/etc/nginx/vhost.d/default_location` file. This file
will be used on any virtual host which does not have a `/etc/nginx/vhost.d/{VIRTUAL_HOST}` file associated with it.
