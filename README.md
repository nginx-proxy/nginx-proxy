nginx-proxy sets up a container running nginx and [docker-gen][1].  docker-gen generates reverse proxy configs for nginx and reloads nginx when containers are started and stopped.

See [Automated Nginx Reverse Proxy for Docker][2] for why you might want to use this.

### Usage

To run it:

    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock -t jwilder/nginx-proxy

Then start any containers you want proxied with an env var VIRTUAL_HOST=subdomain.youdomain.com

    $ docker run -e VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com -t ...

Provided your DNS is setup to forward foo.bar.com to the a host running nginx-proxy, the request will be routed to a container with the VIRTUAL_HOST env var set.

### Multiple Ports

If your container exposes multiple ports, nginx-proxy will default to the service running on port 80.  If you need to specify a different port, you can set a VIRTUAL_PORT env var to select a different one.  If your container only exposes one port and it has a VIRTUAL_HOST env var set, that port will be selected.

### SSL Support

You can enable SSL by setting VIRTUAL_SSL_HOST on your container:

    $ docker run -e VIRTUAL_HOST=foo.bar.com -e VIRTUAL_SSL_HOST=foo.bar.com -t ...

VIRTUAL_SSL_PORT can also be set on your container to override the default port, 443.

Self signed certs are generated on docker build, please replace them with your own for production use.
